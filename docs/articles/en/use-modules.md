Modules are a fundamental part of Vib, likely the thing you will interact with the most. We can see them as the building blocks of your container image, each one performing a specific task.

## Familiarize with Vib Recipes

> **Note**
> Stages were introduced in Vib v0.6.0, if you are using an older version, please keep in mind all the stage fields are at the top level of the recipe, so no multiple stages are supported.

Before diving into the modules, it's important to understand the structure of a Vib recipe.

![Vib Recipe Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vanilla-OS/Vib/main/docs/uploads/vib-recipe-structure.png)

As you can see, a recipe has two main entities:

- **Recipe**: your recipe, the YAML file that contains the instructions to build the image.
- **Stages**: one or more stages that define a set of operations to perform. Each stage can have a set of modules that will be executed in order.

Think of a recipe as a floor plan for a house, and the stages as the rooms. Each room has a set of tasks to complete, and each task is a module but all the rooms together make the house, your container image.

To get more information about the structure of a recipe and its fields, please refer to the [recipe structure](/vib/en/recipe-structure) article.

## Architecture of a Module

A module is a YAML snippet that defines a set of instructions, the common structure is:

```yml
name: name-of-the-module
type: type-of-the-module
# specific fields for the module type
```

While the `name` and `type` fields are mandatory, the specific fields depend on the module type. For example, a `shell` module has a `commands` field that contains the shell commands to execute to complete the task.

You will find that some modules have a common `source` field, this instructs Vib to download a resource required for the module to work:

```yml
- name: vanilla-tools
  type: shell
  source:
    type: tar
    url: https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/vanilla-tools/releases/download/continuous/vanilla-tools.tar.gz
  commands:
    - mkdir -p /usr/bin
    - cp /sources/vanilla-tools/lpkg /usr/bin/lpkg
    - cp /sources/vanilla-tools/cur-gpu /usr/bin/cur-gpu
    - chmod +x /usr/bin/lpkg
    - chmod +x /usr/bin/cur-gpu
```

In the above example we define a `shell` module that downloads a tarball from a GitHub release and then copies the binaries to `/usr/bin`. A source can be of three types:

- `tar`: a tarball archive. You can also define a `checksum` field to verify the integrity of the downloaded archive using a `sha256` hash.
- `file`: a single file. You can also define a `checksum` field to verify the integrity of the downloaded file using a `sha256` hash.
- `git`: a Git repository.

In the latter case, you can specify the branch, tag or commit to checkout like this:

```yaml
name: apx-gui
type: meson
source:
  type: git
  url: https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/apx-gui
  branch: main
  commit: latest
modules:
  - name: apx-gui-deps-install
    type: apt
    source:
      packages:
        - build-essential
        - gettext
        - libadwaita-1-dev
        - meson
```

Supported fields for a git source are:

- `url`: the address of the repository to clone
- `tag`: the tag to checkout, collides with `branch` and `commit`.
- `branch`: the branch to checkout, collides with `tag`.
- `commit`: the commit to checkout, collides with `tag` and `branch`. It can be a commit hash or `latest` to checkout the latest commit.

## Built-in Modules

Vib comes with a set of predefined modules that you can use in your recipes. You can find the list of available modules in the [list of modules](/vib/en/built-in-modules) article.

## Custom Modules via Plugins

You can also extend Vib with custom modules by writing a plugin. Please refer to [making a plugin](/vib/en/make-plugin) for more information.
